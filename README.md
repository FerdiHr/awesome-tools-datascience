*A curated list of awesome tools (libraries, framework,...) for datascience mainly for Python & R*

### Table of contents

* [Environment & IDE](#environment--ide)
* [Data exploration](#data-exploration)
* [Data manipulation](#data-manipulation)
* [Data labelization](#data-labelization)
* [Algorithms](#algorithms)
* [Neural Network & Deep Learning](#neural-network--deep-learning)
* [Data visualization](#data-visualization)
* [Production tools](#production-tools)
* [Data Science Competitions](#competitions)

I often experiment new libraries and often tried out new framework but when I tackle a new problem I would like to have a quick overview of what is existing in the market to not reinvent the wheel. 
I will start to complete this list of tools but I will need help to make it as complete as possible

This tools are only solution which have been approved by the community
